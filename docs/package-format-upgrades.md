# Migrate to new Recipe Documentation

The package format documentation has been split up into multiple pages that each more precisely document each individual setting with examples.

- General layout: [DUB Reference / Recipe](./dub-reference/recipe.md)
- Package settings: [DUB Reference / Package settings](./dub-reference/package_settings.md)
- **Build settings:** [DUB Reference / Build Settings](./dub-reference/build_settings.md)
- Configurations: [DUB Reference / Configurations](./dub-reference/configurations.md)
- Build types: [DUB Reference / Build Types](./dub-reference/buildtypes.md)

## Introducing **DUB Guide**

If you want to learn about the concepts first before diving into the detailed documentation, take a look at the [DUB Guide](./dub-guide/recipe.md) for a more gentle introduction into the package recipes, as well as tutorials that are made by use-case that will link to the reference page.
